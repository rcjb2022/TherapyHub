## 🔄 Keeping Your Local Files in Sync

When I commit files to the repository, **you just need to pull the changes:**

```bash
cd ~/path/to/TherapyHub
git pull origin claude/therapynotes-platform-planning-011CUdbcjuxDKk4oBeqePW5V
```

**That's it!** No need for:
- Re-cloning (you already have the repo)
- CI/CD pipelines (that's for deployment, not local sync)

**Recommended workflow:**
1. I create/modify files and commit to the branch
2. You run `git pull` to get the latest changes
3. You test locally on your Mac
4. When ready, we merge to main and deploy
